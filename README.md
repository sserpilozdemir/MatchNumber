# MatchNumber
 
H E L L O V I S I T E R !

This mini-search project is about "Matching between number to picture" that you can find the project's source: https://fun-javascript-projects.com/course/

I have just learned controlling of two boxes on the web page, also animation codes are very clear and effective.
You can see basic maths in the JS part which is a good way of algorithms.


I hope you enjoy while playing !
